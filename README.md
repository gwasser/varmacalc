# VarmaCalc #

## Description ##

VarmaCalc displays the approximate finite element solution for
some heat transfer scenarios. You can also compare it
to the analytical solution.

This is really just a demo of using Qt/KF6 to
make scientific software. If I have more time,
I'd like to spiff it up. We'll see. But
maybe it will be useful in its current form to someone.

## Building ##

VarmaCalc is primarily written in C++ using Qt6 with the KDE
Frameworks 6 libraries.

More specifically, you need:
* Qt6
* Eigen >= 3.2.2  (MPL2 license)
* KPlotting >= 6.0.0  (LGPLv3 license)
* KUnitConversion >= 6.0.0 (LGPLv3 license)
